# Amazon Clone - Beginner Level

## Overview
This is a beginner-level Amazon clone web application developed by Mahesh Vadla. The project utilizes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), along with Material-UI for styling and Redux for state management. The application aims to replicate some of the core functionalities of the Amazon website, including browsing products, adding them to the cart, and processing orders.

## Features
- User authentication: Users can sign up and log in to the application using their email and password.
- Browse products: Users can view a list of available products with details such as title, price, and images.
- Product details: Users can click on a product to view more detailed information about it.
- Add to cart: Users can add products to their cart to purchase later.
- Cart functionality: Users can manage items in their cart, update quantities, and remove items.
- Checkout process: Users can proceed to the checkout process and place an order.
- Order history: Users can view their past order history.
